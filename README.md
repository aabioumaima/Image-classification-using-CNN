# Image-classification-using-CNN

In this project we will do small image classification using CIFAR10 dataset in tensorflow.
We will use convolutional neural network for this image classification problem. 
First we will train a model using simple artificial neural network and then check how the performance looks like and then we will train a CNN and see how the model accuracy improves. 

This tutorial will help us to understand why CNN is preferred over ANN for image classification.
